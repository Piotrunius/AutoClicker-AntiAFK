    - **Toggle**: Start and stop clicking with a single hotkey press.
    - **Burst**: Execute a defined number of clicks in a burst after pressing the hotkey.
- **Click Customization**:
    - Set a click limit in Toggle mode.
    - Option to click at a fixed, predefined screen position.
    - Option to restrict actions to a specific game window (e.g., Minecraft).
